If $f(x)$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, then there exists a value $c$, where $a<c<b$ such that $f(c)$ is between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$.
#### Example
Determine if there is a value $c$, such that $f(c)=1$, when $f(x)=x$ on $[0,2]$
$f(a)=f(0)=0$
$f(b)=f(2)=2$

$f(0)<f(c)<f(2)$
$0<1<2$
Since $f(x)=x$ is continuous on $[0,2]$, and $f(0)<f(c)<f(2)$, then by the IVT there exists a $c$, such that $0<c<2$.
#### Example
If $f(x)=x^2$ is continuous on $[-1,1]$, does there exist a $c$, such that $f(c)=4$.
$f(a)=f(-1)=1$
$f(b)=f(1)=1$

$f(-1)<f(c)<f(1)$
$1<4<1$
***NOPE***

Since $f(x)=x^2$ is continuous and $f(-1)\leq f(c)\leq f(1)$, the IVT is inconclusive for $-1<c<1$
#### Example
Determine if $f(x)=2x^3-5x^2-10x+5$ has a zero on $[-1,2]$.
(Is there a $c$, such that $f(c)=0$ on $[-1,2]$)

$f(-1)=-2-5+10+5=8$
$f(2)=16-20-20+5=-19$

$f(2)<f(c)<f(-1)$
$-19<0<8$

Since $f(x)$ is a polynomial function it is continuous, and since $f(2)<0<f(-1)$, by the IVT, there exists a $c$, such that $-1<c<2$, where $f(c)=0$.
