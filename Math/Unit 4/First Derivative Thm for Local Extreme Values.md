If $f$ has a local extrema within its domain (excluding endpoints) at a point $c$, then $f^1(c)=0$.

# Critical ~~Friends~~ Point
An interior point on the domain of $f$ where $f^1$ is undefined or zero.
# Finding Absolute Extrema
*Also works for finding any extrema*
1. Find all critical points and end points of $f$.
2. Then we teste all of these values to find the largest and smallest.
#### Example
Find the absolute max and min of $f(x)=x^2$ on $[-2,1]$.
	End points: -2, 1
	$f^1(x)=2x$
	$2x=0$
	$x=0$ - **Critical Point**
	---
	$f(-2)=(-2)^2=4$
	$f(0)=0^2=0$
	$f(1)=1^2=1$
	---
	Abs min is $f(0)=0$.
	The Abs min occurs at $x=0$ and has a value of 0.
	Abs max is at $x=-2$ and has a value of 4.
